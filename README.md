# Leveraging Electric Network Frequency Estimation for Audio Authentication

We would like to acknowledge (Hua et al.) for their work [Robust ENF Estimation Based on Harmonic Enhancement and Maximum Weight Clique](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9494518) which inspired us to develop our robust estimation schemes. We would like to thank them for sharing their codes in [ENF_Enhancement_Estimation](https://github.com/ghua-ac/ENF-WHU-Dataset/tree/master/ENF_Enhancement_Estimation) folder. 

# Our Paper

This repo contains the codes of the proposed Least Absolute Deviations (LAD) ENF estimation described in the [**Leveraging Electric Network Frequency Estimation for Audio Authentication**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10399641) paper. The paper is published in ***IEEE Access***.

# Dataset

For the evaluation of our method, we used the H1 and H1_ref folders of the [ENF-WHU-Dataset](https://github.com/ghuawhu/ENF-WHU-Dataset/tree/master/ENF-WHU-Dataset).

# MATLAB Codes

1. my_test.m (Code for estimating the ENF for all schemes)
2. my_plots.m (Code for generating the figures presented in the paper)
